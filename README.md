## Overview

This is my first parallax animation experiment with Pixi.js.  Everything, you need to run it is contained in this repo.

 Hosted demo available at my blog. 

### Running The Code Locally

	The only requirement is that you not run it from your local filesystem, 
	otherwise you'll have to configure your browser to allow the cross-domain 
	security exception that happens with locally sourced xhrs.  To account for this, 
	you need to host the code on a webserver.  For convenience, I've included a 
	couple of scripts that will start up a local webserver on port 5000 (for Ruby or Python).  
	In anycase, this code relies only on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  Its all front end anyway.

### Hosting Support Scripts

	Ruby: serve_dir_as_http.rb.sh.bat
	Python: serve_dir_as_http.py.sh.bat

	(note: you can use your webserver of choice)
